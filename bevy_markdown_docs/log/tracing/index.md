# Crate tracing 

[Source](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.44/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/src/tracing/lib.rs.html#1-1205)

A scoped, structured logging and diagnostics system.

## Overview

`tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured, event-based diagnostic information.

In asynchronous systems like Tokio, interpreting traditional log messages can often be quite challenging. Since individual tasks are multiplexed on the same thread, associated events and log lines are intermixed making it difficult to trace the logic flow. `tracing` expands upon logging-style diagnostics by allowing libraries and applications to record structured events with additional information about _temporality_ and _causality_ — unlike a log message, a span in `tracing` has a beginning and end time, may be entered and exited by the flow of execution, and may exist within a nested tree of similar spans. In addition, `tracing` spans are _structured_, with the ability to record typed data as well as textual messages.

The `tracing` crate provides the APIs necessary for instrumenting libraries and applications to emit trace data.

_Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.65+](#supported-rust-versions)_

## Core Concepts

The core of `tracing`’s API is composed of _spans_, _events_ and _subscribers_. We’ll cover these in turn.

### Spans

To record the flow of execution through a program, `tracing` introduces the concept of [spans](span/index.html "mod bevy::log::tracing::span"). Unlike a log line that represents a _moment in time_, a span represents a _period of time_ with a beginning and an end. When a program begins executing in a context or performing a unit of work, it _enters_ that context’s span, and when it stops executing in that context, it _exits_ the span. The span in which a thread is currently executing is referred to as that thread’s _current_ span.

For example:

```rust
use tracing::{span, Level};
let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span");
// `enter` returns a RAII guard which, when dropped, exits the span. this
// indicates that we are in the span for the current lexical scope.
let _enter = span.enter();
// perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
```

The [`span` module](span/index.html "mod bevy::log::tracing::span")’s documentation provides further details on how to use spans.

**Warning**: In asynchronous code that uses async/await syntax,
`Span::enter` may produce incorrect traces if the returned drop
guard is held across an await point. See
[the method documentation](struct.Span.html#in-asynchronous-code "struct bevy::log::tracing::Span") for details.

### Events

An [`Event`](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event") represents a _moment_ in time. It signifies something that happened while a trace was being recorded. `Event`s are comparable to the log records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line, an `Event` may occur within the context of a span.

For example:

```rust
use tracing::{event, span, Level};

// records an event outside of any span context:
event!(Level::INFO, "something happened");

let span = span!(Level::INFO, "my_span");
let _guard = span.enter();

// records an event within "my_span".
event!(Level::DEBUG, "something happened inside my_span");
```

In general, events should be used to represent points in time _within_ a span — a request returned with a given status code, _n_ new items were taken from a queue, and so on.

The [`Event` struct](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event") documentation provides further details on using events.

### Subscribers

As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by implementations of the [`Subscriber`](trait.Subscriber.html "trait bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber") trait. `Subscriber`s are notified when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:

*   [`event`](trait.Subscriber.html#tymethod.event "method bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber::event"), called when an `Event` takes place,
*   [`enter`](trait.Subscriber.html#tymethod.enter "method bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber::enter"), called when execution enters a `Span`,
*   [`exit`](trait.Subscriber.html#tymethod.exit "method bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber::exit"), called when execution exits a `Span`

In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`](trait.Subscriber.html#tymethod.enabled "method bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber::enabled") function to _filter_ the notifications they receive based on [metadata](struct.Metadata.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Metadata") describing each `Span` or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will _not_ be notified about the corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently active subscribers express interest in a given set of metadata by returning `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1"
```

### Recording Spans and Events

Spans and events are recorded using macros.

#### Spans

The [`span!`](macro.span.html "macro bevy::log::tracing::span") macro expands to a [`Span` struct](struct.Span.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Span") which is used to record a span. The [`Span::enter`](struct.Span.html#method.enter "method bevy::log::tracing::Span::enter") method on that struct records that the span has been entered, and returns a [RAII](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/main/src/patterns/behavioural/RAII.md) guard object, which will exit the span when dropped.

For example:

```rust
use tracing::{span, Level};
// Construct a new span named "my span" with trace log level.
let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");

// Enter the span, returning a guard object.
let _enter = span.enter();

// Any trace events that occur before the guard is dropped will occur
// within the span.

// Dropping the guard will exit the span.
```

The [`#[instrument]`](https://docs.rs/tracing-attributes/latest/tracing_attributes/attr.instrument.html) attribute provides an easy way to add `tracing` spans to functions. A function annotated with `#[instrument]` will create and enter a span with that function’s name every time the function is called, with arguments to that function will be recorded as fields using `fmt::Debug`.

For example:

[ⓘ](# "This example is not tested")

```rust
use tracing::{Level, event, instrument};

#[instrument]
pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {
    // This event will be recorded inside a span named `my_function` with the
    // field `my_arg`.
    event!(Level::INFO, "inside my_function!");
    // ...
}
```

For functions which don’t have built-in tracing support and can’t have the `#[instrument]` attribute applied (such as from an external crate), the [`Span` struct](struct.Span.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Span") has a [`in_scope()` method](struct.Span.html#method.in_scope "method bevy::log::tracing::Span::in_scope") which can be used to easily wrap synchronous code in a span.

For example:

```rust
use tracing::info_span;

let json = info_span!("json.parse").in_scope(|| serde_json::from_slice(&buf))?;
```

You can find more examples showing how to use this crate [here](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/main/examples).

#### Events

[`Event`](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event")s are recorded using the [`event!`](../macro.event.html "macro bevy::log::event") macro:

```rust
use tracing::{event, Level};
event!(Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
```

### Using the Macros

The [`span!`](macro.span.html "macro bevy::log::tracing::span") and [`event!`](../macro.event.html "macro bevy::log::event") macros as well as the `#[instrument]` attribute use fairly similar syntax, with some exceptions.

#### Configuring Attributes

Both macros require a [`Level`](../struct.Level.html "struct bevy::log::Level") specifying the verbosity of the span or event. Optionally, the, [target](struct.Metadata.html#method.target "method bevy::log::tracing::Metadata::target") and [parent span](span/struct.Attributes.html#method.parent "method bevy::log::tracing::span::Attributes::parent") may be overridden. If the target and parent span are not overridden, they will default to the module path where the macro was invoked and the current span (as determined by the subscriber), respectively.

For example:

```rust
span!(target: "app_spans", Level::TRACE, "my span");
event!(target: "app_events", Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
```

```rust
let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");
event!(parent: &span, Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
```

The span macros also take a string literal after the level, to set the name of the span (as above). In the case of the event macros, the name of the event can be overridden (the default is `event file:line`) using the `name:` specifier.

```rust
span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");
event!(name: "some_info", Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
```

#### Recording Fields

Structured fields on spans and events are specified using the syntax `field_name = field_value`. Fields are separated by commas.

```rust
// records an event with two fields:
//  - "answer", with the value 42
//  - "question", with the value "life, the universe and everything"
event!(Level::INFO, answer = 42, question = "life, the universe, and everything");
```

As shorthand, local variables may be used as field values without an assignment, similar to [struct initializers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-the-field-init-shorthand-when-variables-and-fields-have-the-same-name). For example:

```rust
let user = "ferris";

span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user);
// is equivalent to:
span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user = user);
```

Field names can include dots, but should not be terminated by them:

```rust
let user = "ferris";
let email = "ferris@rust-lang.org";
span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user, user.email = email);
```

Since field names can include dots, fields on local structs can be used using the local variable shorthand:

```rust
let user = User {
    name: "ferris",
    email: "ferris@rust-lang.org",
};
// the span will have the fields `user.name = "ferris"` and
// `user.email = "ferris@rust-lang.org"`.
span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user.name, user.email);
```

Fields with names that are not Rust identifiers, or with names that are Rust reserved words, may be created using quoted string literals. However, this may not be used with the local variable shorthand.

```rust
// records an event with fields whose names are not Rust identifiers
//  - "guid:x-request-id", containing a `:`, with the value "abcdef"
//  - "type", which is a reserved word, with the value "request"
span!(Level::TRACE, "api", "guid:x-request-id" = "abcdef", "type" = "request");
```

Constant expressions can also be used as field names. Constants must be enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) to indicate that the _value_ of the constant is to be used as the field name, rather than the constant’s name. For example:

```rust
const RESOURCE_NAME: &str = "foo";
// this span will have the field `foo = "some_id"`
span!(Level::TRACE, "get", { RESOURCE_NAME } = "some_id");
```

The `?` sigil is shorthand that specifies a field should be recorded using its [`fmt::Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/fmt/trait.Debug.html "trait core::fmt::Debug") implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    field: &'static str,
}

let my_struct = MyStruct {
    field: "Hello world!"
};

// `my_struct` will be recorded using its `fmt::Debug` implementation.
event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = ?my_struct);
// is equivalent to:
event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::debug(&my_struct));
```

The `%` sigil operates similarly, but indicates that the value should be recorded using its [`fmt::Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/fmt/trait.Display.html "trait core::fmt::Display") implementation:

```rust
// `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.
event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = %my_struct.field);
// is equivalent to:
event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::display(&my_struct.field));
```

The `%` and `?` sigils may also be used with local variable shorthand:

```rust
// `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.
event!(Level::TRACE, %my_struct.field);
```

Additionally, a span may declare fields with the special value [`Empty`](field/struct.Empty.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::field::Empty"), which indicates that that the value for that field does not currently exist but may be recorded later. For example:

```rust
use tracing::{trace_span, field};

// Create a span with two fields: `greeting`, with the value "hello world", and
// `parting`, without a value.
let span = trace_span!("my_span", greeting = "hello world", parting = field::Empty);

// ...

// Now, record a value for parting as well.
span.record("parting", &"goodbye world!");
```

Finally, events may also include human-readable messages, in the form of a [format string](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/fmt/index.html#usage "mod alloc::fmt") and (optional) arguments, **after** the event’s key-value fields. If a format string and arguments are provided, they will implicitly create a new field named `message` whose value is the provided set of format arguments.

For example:

```rust
let question = "the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything";
let answer = 42;
// records an event with the following fields:
// - `question.answer` with the value 42,
// - `question.tricky` with the value `true`,
// - "message", with the value "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the
//    universe, and everything is 42."
event!(
    Level::DEBUG,
    question.answer = answer,
    question.tricky = true,
    "the answer to {} is {}.", question, answer
);
```

Specifying a formatted message in this manner does not allocate by default.

#### Shorthand Macros

`tracing` also offers a number of macros with preset verbosity levels. The [`trace!`](../../prelude/macro.trace.html "macro bevy::prelude::trace"), [`debug!`](../../prelude/macro.debug.html "macro bevy::prelude::debug"), [`info!`](../../prelude/macro.info.html "macro bevy::prelude::info"), [`warn!`](../../prelude/macro.warn.html "macro bevy::prelude::warn"), and [`error!`](../../prelude/macro.error.html "macro bevy::prelude::error") behave similarly to the [`event!`](../macro.event.html "macro bevy::log::event") macro, but with the [`Level`](../struct.Level.html "struct bevy::log::Level") argument already specified, while the corresponding [`trace_span!`](../../prelude/macro.trace_span.html "macro bevy::prelude::trace_span"), [`debug_span!`](../../prelude/macro.debug_span.html "macro bevy::prelude::debug_span"), [`info_span!`](../../prelude/macro.info_span.html "macro bevy::prelude::info_span"), [`warn_span!`](../../prelude/macro.warn_span.html "macro bevy::prelude::warn_span"), and [`error_span!`](../../prelude/macro.error_span.html "macro bevy::prelude::error_span") macros are the same, but for the [`span!`](macro.span.html "macro bevy::log::tracing::span") macro.

These are intended both as a shorthand, and for compatibility with the [`log`](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/) crate (see the next section).

#### For `log` Users

Users of the [`log`](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/) crate should note that `tracing` exposes a set of macros for creating `Event`s (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, and `error!`) which may be invoked with the same syntax as the similarly-named macros from the `log` crate. Often, the process of converting a project to use `tracing` can begin with a simple drop-in replacement.

Let’s consider the `log` crate’s yak-shaving example:

[ⓘ](# "This example is not tested")

```rust
use std::{error::Error, io};
use tracing::{debug, error, info, span, warn, Level};

// the `#[tracing::instrument]` attribute creates and enters a span
// every time the instrumented function is called. The span is named after the
// the function or method. Parameters passed to the function are recorded as fields.
#[tracing::instrument]
pub fn shave(yak: usize) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + 'static>> {
    // this creates an event at the DEBUG level with two fields:
    // - `excitement`, with the key "excitement" and the value "yay!"
    // - `message`, with the key "message" and the value "hello! I'm gonna shave a yak."
    //
    // unlike other fields, `message`'s shorthand initialization is just the string itself.
    debug!(excitement = "yay!", "hello! I'm gonna shave a yak.");
    if yak == 3 {
        warn!("could not locate yak!");
        // note that this is intended to demonstrate `tracing`'s features, not idiomatic
        // error handling! in a library or application, you should consider returning
        // a dedicated `YakError`. libraries like snafu or thiserror make this easy.
        return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "shaving yak failed!").into());
    } else {
        debug!("yak shaved successfully");
    }
    Ok(())
}

pub fn shave_all(yaks: usize) -> usize {
    // Constructs a new span named "shaving_yaks" at the TRACE level,
    // and a field whose key is "yaks". This is equivalent to writing:
    //
    // let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shaving_yaks", yaks = yaks);
    //
    // local variables (`yaks`) can be used as field values
    // without an assignment, similar to struct initializers.
    let _span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shaving_yaks", yaks).entered();

    info!("shaving yaks");

    let mut yaks_shaved = 0;
    for yak in 1..=yaks {
        let res = shave(yak);
        debug!(yak, shaved = res.is_ok());

        if let Err(ref error) = res {
            // Like spans, events can also use the field initialization shorthand.
            // In this instance, `yak` is the field being initalized.
            error!(yak, error = error.as_ref(), "failed to shave yak!");
        } else {
            yaks_shaved += 1;
        }
        debug!(yaks_shaved);
    }

    yaks_shaved
}
```

### In libraries

Libraries should link only to the `tracing` crate, and use the provided macros to record whatever information will be useful to downstream consumers.

### In executables

In order to record trace events, executables have to use a `Subscriber` implementation compatible with `tracing`. A `Subscriber` implements a way of collecting trace data, such as by logging it to standard output.

This library does not contain any `Subscriber` implementations; these are provided by [other crates](#related-crates).

The simplest way to use a subscriber is to call the [`set_global_default`](subscriber/fn.set_global_default.html "fn bevy::log::tracing::subscriber::set_global_default") function:

```rust
extern crate tracing;

let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(my_subscriber)
    .expect("setting tracing default failed");
```

     **Warning**: In general, libraries should _not_ call
     `set_global_default()`! Doing so will cause conflicts when
     executables that depend on the library try to set the default later.
 

This subscriber will be used as the default in all threads for the remainder of the duration of the program, similar to setting the logger in the `log` crate.

In addition, the default subscriber can be set through using the [`with_default`](subscriber/fn.with_default.html "fn bevy::log::tracing::subscriber::with_default") function. This follows the `tokio` pattern of using closures to represent executing code in a context that is exited at the end of the closure. For example:

```rust
let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
tracing::subscriber::with_default(my_subscriber, || {
    // Any trace events generated in this closure or by functions it calls
    // will be collected by `my_subscriber`.
})
```

This approach allows trace data to be collected by multiple subscribers within different contexts in the program. Note that the override only applies to the currently executing thread; other threads will not see the change from with\_default.

Any trace events generated outside the context of a subscriber will not be collected.

Once a subscriber has been set, instrumentation points may be added to the executable using the `tracing` crate’s macros.

### `log` Compatibility

The [`log`](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/) crate provides a simple, lightweight logging facade for Rust. While `tracing` builds upon `log`’s foundation with richer structured diagnostic data, `log`’s simplicity and ubiquity make it the “lowest common denominator” for text-based logging in Rust — a vast majority of Rust libraries and applications either emit or consume `log` records. Therefore, `tracing` provides multiple forms of interoperability with `log`: `tracing` instrumentation can emit `log` records, and a compatibility layer enables `tracing` [`Subscriber`](trait.Subscriber.html "trait bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber")s to consume `log` records as `tracing` [`Event`](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event")s.

#### Emitting `log` Records

This crate provides two feature flags, “log” and “log-always”, which will cause [spans](span/index.html "mod bevy::log::tracing::span") and [events](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event") to emit `log` records. When the “log” feature is enabled, if no `tracing` `Subscriber` is active, invoking an event macro or creating a span with fields will emit a `log` record. This is intended primarily for use in libraries which wish to emit diagnostics that can be consumed by applications using `tracing` _or_ `log`, without paying the additional overhead of emitting both forms of diagnostics when `tracing` is in use.

Enabling the “log-always” feature will cause `log` records to be emitted even if a `tracing` `Subscriber` _is_ set. This is intended to be used in applications where a `log` `Logger` is being used to record a textual log, and `tracing` is used only to record other forms of diagnostics (such as metrics, profiling, or distributed tracing data). Unlike the “log” feature, libraries generally should **not** enable the “log-always” feature, as doing so will prevent applications from being able to opt out of the `log` records.

See [here](#crate-feature-flags) for more details on this crate’s feature flags.

The generated `log` records’ messages will be a string representation of the span or event’s fields, and all additional information recorded by `log` (target, verbosity level, module path, file, and line number) will also be populated. Additionally, `log` records are also generated when spans are entered, exited, and closed. Since these additional span lifecycle logs have the potential to be very verbose, and don’t include additional fields, they will always be emitted at the `Trace` level, rather than inheriting the level of the span that generated them. Furthermore, they are categorized under a separate `log` target, “tracing::span” (and its sub-target, “tracing::span::active”, for the logs on entering and exiting a span), which may be enabled or disabled separately from other `log` records emitted by `tracing`.

#### Consuming `log` Records

The [`tracing-log`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-log) crate provides a compatibility layer which allows a `tracing` [`Subscriber`](trait.Subscriber.html "trait bevy::log::tracing::Subscriber") to consume `log` records as though they were `tracing` [events](struct.Event.html "struct bevy::log::tracing::Event"). This allows applications using `tracing` to record the logs emitted by dependencies using `log` as events within the context of the application’s trace tree. See [that crate’s documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-log/latest/tracing_log/#convert-log-records-to-tracing-events) for details.

### Related Crates

In addition to `tracing` and `tracing-core`, the [`tokio-rs/tracing`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) repository contains several additional crates designed to be used with the `tracing` ecosystem. This includes a collection of `Subscriber` implementations, as well as utility and adapter crates to assist in writing `Subscriber`s and instrumenting applications.

In particular, the following crates are likely to be of interest:

*   [`tracing-futures`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-futures) provides a compatibility layer with the `futures` crate, allowing spans to be attached to `Future`s, `Stream`s, and `Executor`s.
*   [`tracing-subscriber`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-subscriber) provides `Subscriber` implementations and utilities for working with `Subscriber`s. This includes a [`FmtSubscriber`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/struct.Subscriber.html) `FmtSubscriber` for logging formatted trace data to stdout, with similar filtering and formatting to the [`env_logger`](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) crate.
*   [`tracing-log`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-log) provides a compatibility layer with the [`log`](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/) crate, allowing log messages to be recorded as `tracing` `Event`s within the trace tree. This is useful when a project using `tracing` have dependencies which use `log`. Note that if you’re using `tracing-subscriber`’s `FmtSubscriber`, you don’t need to depend on `tracing-log` directly.
*   [`tracing-appender`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-appender) provides utilities for outputting tracing data, including a file appender and non blocking writer.

Additionally, there are also several third-party crates which are not maintained by the `tokio` project. These include:

*   [`tracing-timing`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-timing) implements inter-event timing metrics on top of `tracing`. It provides a subscriber that records the time elapsed between pairs of `tracing` events and generates histograms.
*   [`tracing-opentelemetry`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-opentelemetry) provides a subscriber for emitting traces to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)\-compatible distributed tracing systems.
*   [`tracing-honeycomb`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-honeycomb) Provides a layer that reports traces spanning multiple machines to [honeycomb.io](https://www.honeycomb.io/). Backed by [`tracing-distributed`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-distributed).
*   [`tracing-distributed`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-distributed) Provides a generic implementation of a layer that reports traces spanning multiple machines to some backend.
*   [`tracing-actix-web`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-actix-web) provides `tracing` integration for the `actix-web` web framework.
*   [`tracing-actix`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-actix) provides `tracing` integration for the `actix` actor framework.
*   [`axum-insights`](https://crates.io/crates/axum-insights) provides `tracing` integration and Application insights export for the `axum` web framework.
*   [`tracing-gelf`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-gelf) implements a subscriber for exporting traces in Greylog GELF format.
*   [`tracing-coz`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-coz) provides integration with the [coz](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz) causal profiler (Linux-only).
*   [`tracing-bunyan-formatter`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-bunyan-formatter) provides a layer implementation that reports events and spans in [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) format, enriched with timing information.
*   [`tracing-wasm`](https://docs.rs/tracing-wasm) provides a `Subscriber`/`Layer` implementation that reports events and spans via browser `console.log` and [User Timing API (`window.performance`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API).
*   [`tracing-web`](https://docs.rs/tracing-web) provides a layer implementation of level-aware logging of events to web browsers’ `console.*` and span events to the [User Timing API (`window.performance`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API).
*   [`tide-tracing`](https://crates.io/crates/tide-tracing) provides a [tide](https://crates.io/crates/tide) middleware to trace all incoming requests and responses.
*   [`test-log`](https://crates.io/crates/test-log) takes care of initializing `tracing` for tests, based on environment variables with an `env_logger` compatible syntax.
*   [`tracing-unwrap`](https://docs.rs/tracing-unwrap) provides convenience methods to report failed unwraps on `Result` or `Option` types to a `Subscriber`.

If you’re the maintainer of a `tracing` ecosystem crate not listed above, please let us know! We’d love to add your project to the list!

     **Note**: Some of these ecosystem crates are currently
     unreleased and/or in earlier stages of development. They may be less stable
     than `tracing` and `tracing-core`.
 

### Crate Feature Flags

The following crate [feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section) are available:

*   A set of features controlling the [static verbosity level](level_filters/index.html#compile-time-filters "mod bevy::log::tracing::level_filters").
    
*   `log`: causes trace instrumentation points to emit [`log`](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/) records as well as trace events, if a default `tracing` subscriber has not been set. This is intended for use in libraries whose users may be using either `tracing` or `log`.
    
*   `log-always`: Emit `log` records from all `tracing` spans and events, even if a `tracing` subscriber has been set. This should be set only by applications which intend to collect traces and logs separately; if an adapter is used to convert `log` records into `tracing` events, this will cause duplicate events to occur.
    
*   `attributes`: Includes support for the `#[instrument]` attribute. This is on by default, but does bring in the `syn` crate as a dependency, which may add to the compile time of crates that do not already use it.
    
*   `std`: Depend on the Rust standard library (enabled by default).
    
    `no_std` users may disable this feature with `default-features = false`:
    
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    tracing = { version = "0.1.38", default-features = false }
    ```
    

     **Note**: `tracing`'s `no_std` support
     requires `liballoc`.
 

#### Unstable Features

These feature flags enable **unstable** features. The public API may break in 0.1.x releases. To enable these features, the `--cfg tracing_unstable` must be passed to `rustc` when compiling.

The following unstable feature flags are currently available:

*   `valuable`: Enables support for recording [field values](field/index.html "mod bevy::log::tracing::field") using the [`valuable`](https://crates.io/crates/valuable) crate.

##### Enabling Unstable Features

The easiest way to set the `tracing_unstable` cfg is to use the `RUSTFLAGS` env variable when running `cargo` commands:

```
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tracing_unstable" cargo build
```

Alternatively, the following can be added to the `.cargo/config` file in a project to automatically enable the cfg flag for that project:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "tracing_unstable"]
```

### Supported Rust Versions

Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported version is 1.65. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with this policy.
