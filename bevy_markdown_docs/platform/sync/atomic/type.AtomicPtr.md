# Type Alias AtomicPtr 

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/src/core/sync/atomic.rs.html#413)

```rust
pub type AtomicPtr<T> = Atomic<*mut T>;
```

Available on **`target_has_atomic_load_store=ptr`** only.

A raw pointer type which can be safely shared between threads.

This type has the same size and bit validity as a `*mut T`.

**Note**: This type is only available on platforms that support atomic loads and stores of pointers. Its size depends on the target pointer’s size.

## Aliased Type

```rust
pub struct AtomicPtr<T> { /* private fields */ }
```
