Available on **crate feature `keyboard`** only.

The logical key code of a [`KeyboardInput`](struct.KeyboardInput.html "struct bevy::input::keyboard::KeyboardInput").

This contains the actual value that is produced by pressing the key. This is useful when you need the actual letters, and for symbols like `+` and `-` when implementing zoom, as they can be in different locations depending on the keyboard layout.

In many cases you want the key location instead, for example when implementing WASD controls so the keys are located the same place on QWERTY and other layouts. In that case use [`KeyCode`](../../prelude/enum.KeyCode.html "enum bevy::prelude::KeyCode") instead.

### Usage

It is used as the generic `T` value of an [`ButtonInput`](../../prelude/struct.ButtonInput.html "struct bevy::prelude::ButtonInput") to create a `Res<ButtonInput<Key>>`.

### Technical

Its values map 1 to 1 to winit’s Key.

## Variants (Non-exhaustive)

Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants.

### Character([SmolStr](https://docs.rs/smol_str/0.2.2/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/smol_str/struct.SmolStr.html "struct smol_str::SmolStr"))

A key string that corresponds to the character typed by the user, taking into account the user’s current locale setting, and any system-level keyboard mapping overrides that are in effect.

Note that behavior may vary across platforms and keyboard layouts. See the `text` field of [`KeyboardInput`](struct.KeyboardInput.html "struct bevy::input::keyboard::KeyboardInput") for more information.

### Unidentified([NativeKey](enum.NativeKey.html "enum bevy::input::keyboard::NativeKey"))

This variant is used when the key cannot be translated to any other variant.

The native key is provided (if available) in order to allow the user to specify keybindings for keys which are not defined by this API, mainly through some sort of UI.

### Dead([Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/option/enum.Option.html "enum core::option::Option")<[char](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.char.html)\>)
